# Independent Project

Independent Project for the Programming for Social Science module.

This repository will include all the attempts to report from twitter.

The eventual aim of this project is to read out Twitter data based on the use of hasthtags relating to the two main British political parties; Labour and Conservatives. Then to perform a sentiment analysis to try to gauge positive and negative comments.
